<H1>4. Files and Streams</H1>
</CENTER>

<A NAME="S4-1"><H2>4.1. Why Use Files?</H2></A>

<P>All the programs we have looked at so far use input 
only from the keyboard, and output only to the screen. 
If we were restricted to use only the keyboard 
and screen as input and output devices, it would be difficult 
to handle large amounts of input data, and output 
data would always be lost as soon as we turned the 
computer off. To avoid these problems, we can store 
data in some secondary storage device, usually 
magnetic tapes or discs. Data can be created by one 
program, stored on these devices, and then accessed or 
modified by other programs when necessary. To achieve 
this, the data is packaged up on the storage 
devices as data structures called <I>files</I>.</P>

<P>The easiest way to think about a file is as a 
linear sequence of characters. In a simplifed picture (which 
ignores special characters for text formatting) 
these lecture notes might be stored in a file called "Lecture_4" 
as:</P>

<A NAME="S4-2"><H2>4.2 Streams</H2></A>

<P>Before we can work with files in C++, we need to 
become acquainted with the notion of a <I>stream</I>. We can 
think of a stream as a channel or conduit on 
which data is passed from senders to receivers. As far as the  
programs we will use are concerned, streams allow 
travel in only one direction. Data can be sent out from 
the program on an <I>output stream</I>, or received into 
the program on an <I>input stream</I>. For example, at the start 
of a program, the standard input stream "<TT>cin</TT>" is 
connected to the keyboard and the standard output stream 
"<TT>cout</TT>" is connected to the screen.</P>

<P>In fact, input and output streams such as "<TT>cin</TT>" 
and "<TT>cout</TT>" are examples of (stream) <I>objects</I>. So learning 
about streams is a good way to introduce some of 
the syntax and ideas behind the object-oriented part of 
C++. The header file which lists the operations on 
streams both to and from files is called "fstream". We 
will therefore assume that the program fragments 
discussed below are embedded in programs containing the  
"include" statement</P>

<CENTER>
<P>
<TT>#include&lt;fstream&gt;</TT>
</P>
</CENTER>

<P>As we shall see, the essential characteristic of 
stream processing is that data elements must be sent to or 
received from a stream one at a time, i.e. in <I>serial</I> fashion.</P>

<A NAME="S4-2-1"><H3>Creating Streams</H3></A>

<P>Before we can use an input or output stream in a 
program, we must "create" it. Statements to create streams 
look like variable declarations, and are usually 
placed at the top of programs or function implementations 
along with the variable declarations. So for example the statements</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	ifstream in_stream; 
	ofstream out_stream;</TT>
</PRE>

<P>respectively create a stream called "<TT>in_stream</TT>" 
belonging to the <I>class</I> (like type) "<TT>ifstream</TT>" (input-file-stream), 
and a stream called "<TT>out_stream</TT>" 
belonging to the class "<TT>ofstream</TT>" (output-file-stream). 
However, the analogy between streams and ordinary variables 
(of type "<TT>int</TT>", "<TT>char</TT>", etc.) can't be taken 
too far. We cannot, for example, use simple 
assignment statements with streams (e.g. we can't just write 
"<TT>in_stream1 = in_stream2</TT>").</P>

<A NAME="S4-2-2"><H3>Connecting and Disconnecting Streams to Files</H3></A>

<P>Having created a stream, we can connect it to a 
file using the <I>member function</I> "<TT>open(...)</TT>". (We have 
already come across some member functions 
for output streams, such as "<TT>precision(...)</TT>" and 
"<TT>width(...)</TT>", in 
<A HREF="RobMillerL2.html#S2-3">Lecture 2</A>.) The function 
"<TT>open(...)</TT>" 
has a different effect for ifstreams than for ofstreams 
(i.e. the function is polymorphic).</P>

<P>To connect the ifstream "<TT>in_stream</TT>" to the file 
"Lecture_4", we use the following statement:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	in_stream.open("Lecture_4");</TT> 
</PRE>

<P>This connects "<TT>in_stream</TT>" to the beginning of 
"Lecture_4". Diagramatically, we end up in the following 
situation:</P>

<A NAME="F4-2-1"></A>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="RobMillerF4-2-1.GIF" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ISMAP></BR>
<P><B>Figure 4.2.1</B></P>
</CENTER>

<P>To connect the ofstream "<TT>out_stream</TT>" to the file 
"Lecture_4", we use an analogous statement:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	out_stream.open("Lecture_4");</TT> 
</PRE>

<P>Although this connects "<TT>out_stream</TT>" to "Lecture_4", 
it also deletes the previous contents of the file, 
ready for new input. Diagramatically, we end up as follows:</P>

<A NAME="F4-2-2"></A>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="RobMillerF4-2-2.GIF" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ISMAP></BR>
<P><B>Figure 4.2.2</B></P>
</CENTER>

<P>To disconnect connect the ifstream "<TT>in_stream</TT>" 
to whatever file it is connected to, we write:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	in_stream.close();</TT> 
</PRE>

<P>Diagramatically, the situation changes from that of Figure 4.2.1 to:</P>

<A NAME="F4-2-3"></A>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="RobMillerF4-2-3.GIF" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ISMAP></BR></BR>
<P><B>Figure 4.2.3</B></P>
</CENTER>


<P>The statement:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	out_stream.close();</TT> 
</PRE>

<P>has a similar effect, but in addition the system 
will "clean up" by adding an "end-of-file" marker at the end 
of the file. Thus, if no data has been output to 
"Lecture_4" since "<TT>out_stream</TT>" was connected to it, we 
change from the situation in Figure 4.2.2 to:</P>

<A NAME="F4-2-4"></A>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="RobMillerF4-2-4.GIF" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ISMAP></BR></BR>
<P><B>Figure 4.2.4</B></P>
</CENTER>

<P>In this case, the file "Lecture_4" still exists, but is <I>empty</I>.</P>

<A NAME="S4-3"><H2>4.3 Checking for Failure with File Commands</H2></A>

<P>File operations, such as opening and closing files, 
are a notorious source of errors. Robust commercial 
programs should always include some check to make 
sure that file operations have completed successfully, 
and error handling routines in case they haven't. 
A simple checking mechanism is provided by the member 
function "<TT>fail()</TT>". The function call</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	in_stream.fail();</TT>
</PRE>

<P>returns True if the previous stream operation on 
"<TT>in_stream</TT>" was not successful (perhaps we tried to 
open a file which didn't exist). If a failure has 
occurred, "<TT>in_stream</TT>" may be in a corrupted state, and it 
is best not to attempt any more operations with it. 
The following example program fragment plays very safe 
by quitting the program entirely, using the "<TT>exit(1)</TT>" 
command from the library "cstdlib":</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	#include &lt;iostream&gt;
	#include &lt;fstream&gt;
	#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;

	using namespace std;
	
	int main()
	{
		ifstream in_stream;
	
		in_stream.open("Lecture_4");
		if (in_stream.fail())
		{
			cout &lt;&lt; "Sorry, the file couldn't be opened!\n";
			exit(1);
		}
		...</TT>

<A NAME="S4-4"><H2>4.4 Character Input and Output</H2></A>

<A NAME="S4-4-1"><H3>Input using "<TT>get(...)</TT>"</H3></A>

<P>Having opened an input file, we can extract or read 
single characters from it using the member function 
"<TT>get(...)</TT>". This function takes a single argument of 
type "<TT>char</TT>". If the program is in the state represented 
in <A HREF="#F4-2-1">Figure 4.2.1</A>, the statement</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	in_stream.get(ch);</TT>
</PRE>

<P>has two effects: (i) the variable "<TT>ch</TT>" is assigned the 
value "<TT>'4'</TT>", and (ii) the ifstream "<TT>in_stream</TT>" is re-
positioned so as to be ready to input the next 
character in the file. Diagramatically, the new situation is:</P>

<P><B>Figure 4.4.1</B></P>
</CENTER>

<A NAME="S4-4-2"><H3>Output using "<TT>put(...)</TT>"</H3></A>

<P>We can input or <I>write</I> single characters to a file 
opened via an ofstream using the member function 
"<TT>put(...)</TT>". Again, this function takes a single 
argument of type "<TT>char</TT>". If the program is in the state 
represented in <A HREF="#F4-2-2">Figure 4.2.2</A>, the statement</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	out_stream.put('4');</TT> 
</PRE>

<P>changes the state to:</P>

<P><B>Figure 4.4.2</B></P>
</CENTER>

<A NAME="S4-4-3"><H3>The "<TT>putback(...)</TT>" Function</H3></A>

<P>C++ also includes a "<TT>putback(...)</TT>" function for ifstreams. 
This doesn't really "put the character back" (it 
doesn't alter the actual input file), but behaves as 
if it had. Diagramatically, if we started from the state in 
<A HREF="#F4-4-1">Figure 4.4.1</A>, and executed the statement</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	in_stream.putback(ch);</TT> 
</PRE>

<P>we would end up in the state:</P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="RobMillerF4-4-3.GIF" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ISMAP></BR>
<P><B>Figure 4.4.3</B></P>
</CENTER>

<P>Indeed, we can "putback" any character we want to. 
The alternative statement</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	in_stream.putback('7');</TT> 
</PRE>

<P>would result in:</P>

<A NAME="S4-5-1"><H3>4.5.1 End-of-file Checking For Systems 
Which Implement "<TT>eof()</TT>"</H3></A>

<P>Special care has to be taken with input when the 
end of a file is reached. Most versions of C++ (including GNU g++ and Microsoft Visual C++) incorporate an end-of-file 
(EOF) <I>flag</I>, and a member function called 
"<TT>eof()</TT>" for ifstreams to test if this flag is set to 
True or False. It's worth discussing such systems 
briefly, since many text books (including 
<A HREF="CourseStructure.html#Books">Savitch</A>) 
assume this useful facility.</P>

<P>In such systems, when an ifstream is initially 
connected to a file, the EOF flag is set to False (even if the 
file is empty). However, if the ifstream "<TT>in_stream</TT>" 
is positioned at the end of a file, and the EOF flag is 
False, the statement</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	in_stream.get(ch);</TT> 
</PRE>

<P>will leave the variable "<TT>ch</TT>" in an unpredictable state, 
and set the EOF flag to True. Once the EOF flag is 
set to True, no attempt should be made to read from 
the file, since the results will be unpredictable. To 
illustrate with a diagramatic example, if we start from</P>

<A NAME="S4-7"><H2>4.7 Input and Output Using 
"<TT>&gt;&gt;</TT>" and "<TT>&lt;&lt;</TT>"</H2></A>

<P>So far we have only talked about writing and 
reading individual characters to and from files. At the lowest 
level, ofstreams and ifstreams only deal 
with files which are sequences of characters. 
So data of other types 
("<TT>int</TT>", "<TT>double</TT>", etc.) has to be converted into 
character sequences before it can be written to a file, and 
these character sequences have to be converted 
back again when they are input.</P>

<P>However, the operators "<TT>&gt;&gt;</TT>" and "<TT>&lt;&lt;</TT>", 
which we have already met in the context of keyboard input and 
screen output, do some of this conversion automatically. 
For example, from the state</P>

</CENTER>

<P>When using these higher level facilities, it is 
important to include at least one <TT>' '</TT> (blank) character (or a 
new-line character) after each item of data written. 
This ensures that the data items are correctly separated in 
the file, ready for input using "<TT>&gt;&gt;</TT>". For 
example, from the state</P>

<P>In this lecture we have seen how programs may be connected 
to external files for input and output using

"<TT>get(...)</TT>" and "<TT>put(...)</TT>", and how "high-level" 
input and output 
of other kinds of data types can be 
achieved using the stream operators "<TT>&gt;&gt;</TT>" and "<TT>&lt;&lt;</TT>".
