<H1>6. Arrays and Strings</H1>
</CENTER>


<A NAME="S6-1"><H2>6.1 The Basic Idea and Notation</H2></A>

<P>Although we have already seen how to store large 
amounts of data in files, we have as yet no convenient 
way to manipulate such data from within programs. 
For example, we might want to write a program that 
inputs and then ranks or sorts a long list of numbers. 
C++ provides a <I>structured data type</I> called an <I>array</I> to 
facilitate this kind of task. The use of arrays permits 
us to set aside a group of memory locations (i.e. a 
group of variables) that we can then manipulate as a 
single entity, but that at the same time gives us direct 
access to any individual component. Arrays are simple 
examples of structured data types - they are 
effectively just lists of variables all of the same 
data type ("<TT>int</TT>", "<TT>char</TT>" or whatever). Later in the course 
you will learn how to construct more complicated 
compound data structures.</P>

<A NAME="S6-1-1"><H3>Declaring an array</H3></A>

<P>The general syntax for an array declaration is:</P>


<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	&lt;component type&gt;  &lt;variable identifier&gt;[&lt;integer value&gt;];</TT>
</PRE>

<P>For example, suppose we are writing a program to 
manipulate data concerning the number of hours a group 
of 6 employees have worked in a particular week. 
We might start the program with the array declaration:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	int hours[6];</TT>
</PRE>

<P>or better,</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	const int NO_OF_EMPLOYEES = 6;
	int hours[NO_OF_EMPLOYEES];</TT>
</PRE>

<P>Indeed, if we are going to use a number of such arrays 
in our program, we can even use a <I>type definition</I>:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	const int NO_OF_EMPLOYEES = 6;
	typedef int Hours_array[NO_OF_EMPLOYEES];
	Hours_array hours;
	Hours_array hours_week_two;</TT>
</PRE>

<P>In each case, we end up with 6 variables of type "<TT>int</TT>" with identifiers</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	hours[0]   hours[1]   hours[2]   hours[3]   hours[4]   hours[5]</TT>
</PRE>

<P>Each of these is referred to as an <I>element</I> or <I>component</I> 
of the array. The numbers <TT>0</TT>, ..., <TT>5</TT> are the <I>indexes</I> 
or <I>subscripts</I> of the components. An important feature 
of these 6 variables is that they are allocated 
consecutive memory locations in the computer. We can picture this as:</P>

HREF="CourseStructure.html#S6">
(BACK TO COURSE CONTENTS)</A><BR></P>

<A NAME="S6-1-2"><H3>Assignment Statements and Expressions with Array Elements</H3></A>

<P>Having declared our array, we can treat the individual 
elements just like ordinary variables (of type "<TT>int</TT>" 
in the particular example above). In particular, we can 
write assignment statements such as</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	hours[4] = 34;
	hours[5] = hours[4]/2;</TT>
</PRE>

<P>and use them in logical expressions, e.g.</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	if (number &lt; 4 &amp;&amp; hours[number] &gt;= 40) { ...</TT>
</PRE>

<A NAME="Program6-1-1"></A>
<P>A common way to assign values to an array is using 
a "for" or "while" loop. The following program 
prompts the user for the number of hours that 
each employee has worked. It is more natural to number 
employees from 1 to 6 than from 0 to 5, but it is 
important to remember that array indexes always start from 
0. Hence the program subtracts 1 from each employee 
number to obtain the corresponding array index.</P>


<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	#include &lt;iostream&gt;
	using namespace std;
	
	const int NO_OF_EMPLOYEES = 6;
	typedef int Hours_array[NO_OF_EMPLOYEES];
	
	int main()
	{
		Hours_array hours;
		int count;
	
		for (count = 1 ; count &lt;= NO_OF_EMPLOYEES ; count++)
		{
			cout &lt;&lt; "Enter hours for employee number " &lt;&lt; count &lt;&lt; ": ";
			cin &gt;&gt; hours[count - 1];
		}
	
		return 0;
	}</TT>
</PRE>

<CENTER>
<P>
<B><A HREF="RobMiller6-1-1.cpp">
Program 6.1.1</A></B></P>
</CENTER>

<P>A typical run might produce the following input/output:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	Enter hours for employee number 1: 38
	Enter hours for employee number 2: 42
	Enter hours for employee number 3: 29
	Enter hours for employee number 4: 35
	Enter hours for employee number 5: 38
	Enter hours for employee number 6: 37</TT>
</PRE>

<P>in which case our block of variables would then be in the state:</P>

<A NAME="F6-1-2"></A>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="RobMillerF6-1-2.GIF" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ISMAP></BR>
<P><B>Figure 6.1.2</B></P>
</CENTER>

<P>It is instructive to consider what would have happened 
had we forgotten to subtract 1 from the variable 
"<TT>count</TT>" in the "<TT>cin ...</TT>" statement (within the "for" 
loop) in <A HREF="#Program6-1-1">Program 6.1.1</A>. Unlike some languages, 
C++ does not do range bound error checking, so we 
would have simply ended up in the state:</P>


<A NAME="F6-1-3"></A>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="RobMillerF6-1-3.GIF" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ISMAP></BR>
<P><B>Figure 6.1.3 - A Range Bound Error</B></P>
</CENTER>


<P>In other words, C++ would have simply put the value 
"37" into the next integer-sized chunk of memory 
located after the memory block set aside for the 
array "<TT>hours</TT>". This is a very undesirable situation - the 
compiler might have already reserved this chunk of 
memory for another variable (perhaps, for example, for 
the variable "<TT>count</TT>").</P>

<P>Array elements can be of data types other than "<TT>int</TT>". 
Here's a program that prints itself out backwards on 
the screen, using an array of type "<TT>char</TT>".</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	#include &lt;iostream&gt;
	#include &lt;fstream&gt;
	
	using namespace std;

	const int MAX = 1000;
	typedef char File_array[MAX];
	
	int main()
	{
		char character;
		File_array file;
		int count;
		ifstream in_stream;
	
		in_stream.open("6-1-2.cpp");
		in_stream.get(character);
		for (count = 0 ; ! in_stream.eof() &amp;&amp; count &lt; MAX ; count++) 
		{
			file[count] = character;
			in_stream.get(character);
		}
		in_stream.close();
	
		while (count &gt; 0)
			cout &lt;&lt; file[--count];

		return 0;
	}</TT>
</PRE>

<CENTER>
<P><B><A HREF="RobMiller6-1-2.cpp">
Program 6.1.2</A></B></P>
</CENTER>

<P>Note the use of the condition "<TT>... &amp;&amp; count &lt; MAX ; ...</TT>" 
in the head of the "for" loop, to avoid 
the possibility of a range bound error.</P>

<A NAME="S6-2"><H2>6.2 Arrays as Parameters in Functions</H2></A>

<P>Functions can be used with array parameters to maintain a 
structured design. Here is a definition of an 
example function which returns the average hours worked, 
given an array of type "<TT>Hours_array</TT>" from 
<A HREF="#Program6-1-1">Program 6.1.1</A></P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	float average(Hours_array hrs)
	{
		float total = 0;
		int count;
		for (count = 0 ; count &lt; NO_OF_EMPLOYEES ; count++)
			total += float(hrs[count]);
		return (total / NO_OF_EMPLOYEES);
	}</TT>
</PRE>

<CENTER>
<P><B>Fragment of <A HREF="RobMiller6-2-1.cpp">Program 6.2.1</A></B></P>
</CENTER>

<P>We could make this function more general by including 
a second parameter for the length of the array:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	float average(int list[], int length)
	{
		float total = 0;
		int count;
		for (count = 0 ; count &lt; length ; count++)
			total += float(list[count]);
		return (total / length);
	}</TT>
</PRE>

<P>It is quite common to pass the array length to a 
function along with an array parameter, since the syntax for 
an array parameter (such as "<TT>int list[]</TT>" above) 
doesn't include the array's length.</P>

<P>Although array parameters are not declared with an "<TT>&amp;</TT>" 
character in function declarations and definitions, 
they are effectively reference parameters (rather than 
value parameters). In other words, when they execute, 
functions do not make private copies of the arrays they 
are passed (this would potentially be very expensive 
in terms of memory). Hence, like the 
<A 
HREF="RobMillerL3.html#S3-3-2">reference parameters we have seen in Lecture 
3</A>,
arrays can be 
permanently changed when passed as arguments to functions. 
For example, after a call to the following 
function, each element in the third array argument is equal 
to the sum of the corresponding two elements in 
the first and second arguments:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	void add_lists(int first[], int second[], int total[], int length)
	{
		int count;
		for (count = 0 ; count &lt; length ; count++)
			total[count] = first[count] + second[count];
	}</TT>
</PRE>

<CENTER>
<P><B>Fragment of <A HREF="RobMiller6-2-2.cpp">Program 6.2.2</A></B></P>
</CENTER>

<P>As a safety measure, we can add the modifier 
"<TT>const</TT>" in the function head:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	void add_lists(const int fst[], const int snd[], int tot[], int len)
	{
		int count;
		for (count = 0 ; count &lt; len; count++)
			tot[count] = fst[count] + snd[count];
	}</TT>
</PRE>

<P>The compiler will then not accept any statements within the 
function's definition which potentially modify 
the elements of the arrays "<TT>fst</TT>" or "<TT>snd</TT>". Indeed, 
the restriction imposed by the "<TT>const</TT>" modifier when 
used in this context is stronger than really needed 
in some situations. For example, the following two 
function definitions will not be accepted by the compiler:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	void no_effect(const int list[])
	{
		do_nothing(list);
	}
	
	void do_nothing(int list[])
	{
		;
	}</TT>
</PRE>

<CENTER>
<P><B>Fragment of <A HREF="RobMiller6-2-3.cpp">Program 6.2.3</A></B></P>
</CENTER>

<P>This is because, although we can see that "<TT>do_nothing(...)</TT>" 
does nothing, its head doesn't include the 
modifier "<TT>const</TT>", and the compiler only looks at the head 
of "<TT>do_nothing(...)</TT>" when checking to see if 
the call to this function from within "<TT>no_effect(...)</TT>" is legal.</P>

<A NAME="S6-3"><H2>6.3 Sorting Arrays</H2></A>

<P>Arrays often need to be sorted in either ascending or descending
order. There are many well known methods for doing this; the <I>quick
sort</I> algorithm is among the most efficient. This section briefly
describes one of the easiest sorting methods called the <I>selection
sort</I>.</P>

<P>The basic idea of selection sort is:</P>

<P>For each index position I in turn:</P>

<OL>
<LI>
Find the smallest data value in the array from positions I to 
(Length - 1), where 
"Length" is the number of data values stored.
</LI>
<LI>
Exchange the smallest value with the value at position I.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>To see how selection works, consider an array of 
five integer values, declared as</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	int a[5];</TT>
</PRE>

<P>and initially in the state:</P>

<A NAME="F6-3-1"></A>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="RobMillerF6-3-1.GIF" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ISMAP></BR>
<P><B>Figure 6.3.1</B></P>
</CENTER>

<P>Selection sort takes the array through the following sequence of states:</P>

<A NAME="F6-3-2"></A>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="RobMillerF6-3-2.GIF" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ISMAP></BR>
<P><B>Figure 6.3.2</B></P>
</CENTER>
       
<P>Each state is generated from the previous one by swapping the 
two elements of the array marked with a "bullet".</P>

<P>We can code this procedure in C++ with three functions. 
The top level function "<TT>selection_sort(...)</TT>" 
(which takes and array and an integer argument) sorts its 
first (array) argument by first calling the function 
"<TT>minimum_from(array,position,length)</TT>", which returns the 
index of the smallest element in 
"<TT>array</TT>" which is positioned at or after the index "<TT>position</TT>". 
It then swaps values according to the 
specification above, using the "<TT>swap(...)</TT>" function:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	void selection_sort(int a[], int length)
	{
		for (int count = 0 ; count &lt; length - 1 ; count++)
			swap(a[count],a[minimum_from(a,count,length)]);
	}
	
	int minimum_from(int a[], int position, int length)
	{
		int min_index = position;
	
		for (int count = position + 1 ; count &lt; length ; count ++)
			if (a[count] &lt; a[min_index])
				min_index = count;
	
		return min_index;
	}
	
	void swap(int&amp; first, int&amp; second)
	{
		int temp = first;
		first = second;
		second = temp;
	}</TT>

<A NAME="S6-4"><H2>6.4 Two-dimensional Arrays</H2></A>

<P>Arrays can have more than one dimension. In this section we briefly 
examine the use of two-dimensional 
arrays to represent two-dimensional structures such as screen 
bitmaps or nxm matrices of integers.</P>

<P>A bitmap consists of a grid of Boolean values 
representing the state of the dots or pixels on a screen. "True" 
means "on" or that the pixel is white; "False" 
means "off" or the pixel is black. Let's suppose the screen is 
639 pixels wide and 449 pixels high. We can 
declare the corresponding array as follows:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	enum Logical {False, True};
	const int SCREEN_HEIGHT = 449;
	const int SCREEN_WIDTH = 639;
	Logical screen[SCREEN_HEIGHT][SCREEN_WIDTH];</TT>
</PRE>

<P>References to individual data elements within the array 
"<TT>screen</TT>" simply use two index values. For 
example, the following statement assigns the value 
"<TT>True</TT>" to the cell (pixel) in row 4, column 2 of the 
array.</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	screen[3][1] = True;</TT>
</PRE>

<P>All of the discussion in <A HREF="#S6-2">Section 6.2</A> about one-dimensional 
arrays as parameters in functions also applies to 
two-dimensional arrays, but with one additional peculiarity. 
In function declarations and in the heads of 
function definitions, the size of the first dimension of a 
multidimensional array parameter is not given 
(inside the "<TT>[]</TT>" brackets), but the sizes of all the other 
dimensions are given. Hence, for example, the 
following is a correct form for a function which sets all 
the screen pixels to black:</P>


<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	void clear_bitmap(Logical bitmap[][SCREEN_WIDTH], int screen_height)
	{
		for (int row = 0 ; row &lt; screen_height ; row++)
			for (int column = 0 ; column &lt; SCREEN_WIDTH; column++)
				bitmap[row][column] = False;

<A NAME="S6-5"><H2>6.5 Strings</H2></A>

<P>We have already been using string values, such as 
"<TT>"Enter age: "</TT>", in programs involving output to 
the screen. In C++ you can store and manipulate such 
values in <I>string variables</I>, which are really just arrays 
of characters, but used in a particular way.</P>

<A NAME="S6-5-1"><H3>The Sentinel String Character '\0'</H3></A>

<P>The key point is that, to use the special functions associated 
with strings, string values can only be stored in 
string variables whose length is <I>at least 1 greater than</I> 
the length (in characters) of the value. This is because 
extra space must be left at the end to store the <I>sentinel 
string character</I> "<TT>'\0'</TT>" which marks the end of the 
string value. For example, the following two arrays both 
contain all the characters in the string value 
"<TT>"Enter age: "</TT>", but only the array on the left contains 
a proper string representation.</P>

<A NAME="F6-5-1"></A>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="RobMillerF6-5-1.GIF" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ISMAP></BR>
<P><B>Figure 6.5.1</B></P>
</CENTER>


<P>In other words, although both "<TT>phrase</TT>" and "<TT>list</TT>" are 
arrays of characters, only "<TT>phrase</TT>" is big 
enough to contain the string value "<TT>"Enter age: "</TT>".
 We don't care what characters are stored in the 
variables "<TT>phrase[12]</TT>" and "<TT>phrase[13]</TT>", because all 
the string functions introduced below ignore 
characters after the "<TT>'\0'</TT>".</P>

<A NAME="S6-5-2"><H3>String Variable Declarations and Assignments</H3></A>



<P>String variables can be declared just like other arrays:</P>


<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	char phrase[14];</TT>
</PRE>

<P>String arrays can be initialised or partially 
initialised at the same time as being declared, using a list of 
values enclosed in "{}" braces (the same is true 
of arrays of other data types). For example, the statement</P>


<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	char phrase[14] = {'E','n','t','e','r',' ','a','g','e',':',' ','\0'};</TT>
</PRE>

<P>both declares the array "phrase" and initialises 
it to the state in Figure 6.5.1. The statement</P>


<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	char phrase[14] = "Enter age: ";</TT>
</PRE>

<P>is equivalent. If the "14" is omitted, an array 
will be created just large enough to contain both the value 
""Enter age: "" and the sentinel character "'\0'", 
so that the two statements</P>


<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	char phrase[] = {'E','n','t','e','r',' ','a','g','e',':',' ','\0'};
char phrase[] = "Enter age: ";</TT>
</PRE>

<P>are equivalent both to each other and to the statement</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	char phrase[12] = "Enter age: ";</TT>
</PRE>

<P>However, it is important to remember that string 
variables are arrays, so we cannot just make assignments 
and comparisons using the operators "=" and "==". 
We cannot, for example, simply write</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	phrase = "You typed: ";</TT>
</PRE>

<P>Instead, we can use a special set of functions for 
string assignment and comparison.</P>

<P><A 
HREF="CourseStructure.html#S6">
(BACK TO COURSE CONTENTS)</A><BR></P>

<A NAME="S6-5-3"><H3>Some Predefined String Functions</H3></A>

<P>The library <tt>cstring</tt> (old style header <tt>string.h</tt>)
contains a number of useful functions for string operations. We will
assume that the program fragments discussed below are embedded 
in programs containing the  "include" statement</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
	<TT>#include&lt;cstring&gt;</TT>
</PRE>


<P>Given the string variable "<TT>a_string</TT>", we can copy 
a specific string value or the contents of another string 
to it using the two argument function "<TT>strcpy(...)</TT>". 
Hence the statement</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
	<TT>strcpy(a_string, "You typed: ");</TT>
</PRE>

<P>assigns the first 11 elements of  "<TT>a_string</TT>" to 
the respective characters in "<TT>"You typed: "</TT>", and 
assigns the sentinel character "<TT>'\0'</TT>" to the 12th 
element. The call</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
	<TT>strcpy(a_string, another_string);</TT>
</PRE>

<P>copies the string value stored in "<TT>another_string</TT>" to 
"<TT>a_string</TT>". But care has to be taken with this 
function. If  "<TT>a_string</TT>" is less than (1 + L), where L 
is the length of the string value currently stored in 
"<TT>another_string</TT>", the call to the function will 
cause a range bound error which will not be detected by 
the compiler.</P>


<P>We can, however, check the length of the value stored 
in "<TT>another_string</TT>" using the function  
"<TT>strlen(...)</TT>". The call "<TT>strlen(another_string)</TT>" returns 
the length of the current string stored in 
"<TT>another_string</TT>" (the character  "<TT>'\0'</TT>" is not counted).</P>

<P>The comparison function "<TT>strcmp(...)</TT>" returns "False" (i.e. 0) 
if its two string arguments are the same, and 
the two argument function "<TT>strcat(...)</TT>" concatenates its 
second argument onto the end of its first 
argument. 
<A HREF="#Program6-5-1">Program 6.5.1</A> 
illustrates the use of these 
functions. Again, care must be taken with 
"<TT>strcat(...)</TT>". C++ does not check that the first variable 
argument is big enough to contain the two 
concatenated strings, so that once again there is a danger 
of undetected range bound errors.</P>

<A NAME="S6-5-4"><H3>String Input using "<TT>getline(...)</TT>"</H3></A>

<P>Although the operator "<TT>&gt;&gt;</TT>" can be used to input strings 
(e.g. from the keyboard), its use is limited because 
of the way it deals with space characters. Supposing a 
program which includes the statements</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	...
	...
	cout &lt;&lt; "Enter name: ";
	cin &gt;&gt; a_string;

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	...
	...
	Enter name: <B>Rob Miller</B>
	...
	...</TT>
</PRE>

<P>The string variable will then contain the string 
value "<TT>"Rob"</TT>", because the operator "<TT>&gt;&gt;</TT>" 
assumes that the 
space character signals the end of input. It is 
therefore often better to use the two argument function 
"<TT>getline(...)</TT>". For example, the statement</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	cin.getline(a_string,80);</TT>
</PRE>

<A NAME="Program6-5-1"></A>

long, including spaces. (The extra element is for the

<P>A example input/output session is:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=100>
<TT>	Enter first string: <B>Hello class.</B>
	Enter second string: <B>Hello Rob.</B>
	Before copying the strings were not the same.
	After copying the strings were the same.
	After concatenating, the first string is: Hello Rob.Hello Rob.</TT>

<A NAME="S6-6"><H2>6.6 Summary</H2></A>

<P>In this lecture we have seen how a list of variables 
of the same data type may be represented as an array. 
We have seen how arrays may be passed as parameters to 
functions, and we have seen a simple algorithm 
for sorting arrays. We have also briefly discussed the 
notion of a two-dimensional array. Finally, we have 
seen that C++ provides some special functions to 
manipulate strings, which are simply arrays of characters 
always including a special sentinel character. 
The material here is also covered in more detail in 
<A HREF="CourseStructure.html#Books">Savitch</A>, 
Chapter 7 and Chapter 8.</P>
